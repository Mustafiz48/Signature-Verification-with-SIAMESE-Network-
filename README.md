# Signature verification with SIAMESE network architecture

I have used SIAMESE architecture to verify signatures. Given two signatures, the model will verify wheather they are of the same person's or not. 

The dataset for training the network can be found in this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QbVb7lA0vDNIziVNi6cc_8DKOHH-3LJn

I have directly used data from the drive folder for conveniece, please chage the data reading part accordingly for your case
